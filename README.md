## Changes to be made
1. 1st top nav bar should divide into 2 bars at 900px both centered, or search and gift cert links should move down instead
1. 2nd top nav should break into 2 bars at below 1165 both centered

## Mobile changes
1. top brown bar should not shrink on menu open
1. drop downs should be indented and divider lines added to emphasize the seperation between main nav links and dropdown links
1. Sign in or Register links should stay in the top right like the cart link does
1. divs will be rearranged to allow for shifting of items with flexbox rather than repeating them later for mobile only
1. left and right buttons on slide show jump up in mobile. Those will be adjusted to stay centered like they are on desktop view.
1. featured Producst will be one column in mobile rather than two. Two columns works fine at larger sizes like 550px but at sizes like below 450 the items become a bit too small, thus a new breakpoint will be added to allow it to shift from 2 to one column
1. make sure there is always a margin on the left and right of the large text blocks at the bottom. At lower pixels it no longer has a margin and touches the side of the screen. Adding even a small margin will help with readability.
1. No problems with footer, it scales nicely unitl it is one column
